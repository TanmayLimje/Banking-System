# Mini-Project-OOP

Banking System

In this Mini project we use the concept of OOP and create a Bank Inteface for the users
In which the user is allowed to create a Account or log into existing (As the code is dynamic, 1 user can create multiple accounts and log back in using his/her name).
It can perform tasks like to check the account information, Diposit and Withdraw, show daily withdraw limit, check balance.
